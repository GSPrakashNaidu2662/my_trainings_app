# my_trainings_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.


 To run a Flutter application, you'll need to follow a series of steps to set up your development environment, create a new Flutter project, and then run the application. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

# Prerequisites
## Install Flutter SDK:

Download the Flutter SDK from the official Flutter website.
Extract the downloaded file and add the flutter/bin directory to your system's PATH.
## Install Dart:

Dart is included with the Flutter SDK, so you don't need to install it separately.
Set Up an Editor:

You can use any text editor, but it's recommended to use an IDE like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio with Flutter and Dart plugins installed.
## Install Additional Tools:

For Android development, install Android Studio and set up the Android SDK.
For iOS development, you need a Mac with Xcode installed.
## Set Up Device:

You can run your Flutter app on an emulator or a physical device. For Android, you can use Android Virtual Device (AVD) or connect an Android device via USB. For iOS, you can use the iOS Simulator or a physical iOS device.

# Steps to Run a Flutter Application

## Navigate to the Project Directory:

Open In Editor
cd my_trainings_app


## Open the Project in Your Editor:

Open the project folder in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code or Android Studio).


## Run the Application:

Make sure your device or emulator is running.
In the terminal, run:
flutter run

Alternatively, if you are using an IDE, you can usually find a "Run" button or option in the menu.

##Hot Reload:
While the app is running, you can make changes to your code and save the file. Use the r key in the terminal or the hot reload button in your IDE to see the changes instantly.


# Troubleshooting
## If you encounter issues, check the output of flutter doctor for any missing dependencies or configurations.
  1. Ensure that your device is connected and recognized by running flutter devices.
  2. By following these steps, you should be able to successfully run a Flutter application on your device or emulator. Happy coding!
